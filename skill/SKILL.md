# Vapi - AI Voice Assistant Builder

Build AI-powered voice assistants, phone agents, and conversational AI applications with Vapi.

## When This Skill is Activated

When a user wants to build a voice assistant or phone agent, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check if Vapi MCP is Installed

First, check if the Vapi MCP server is available by looking for `vapi_` tools. If not available, tell the user to run:

```bash
claude mcp add vapi -- npx -y @vapi-ai/mcp-server
```

Then restart Claude Code and continue with Step 2.

### Step 2: Authenticate with Vapi

If the user hasn't authenticated yet (tools return auth errors):

1. Call `vapi_login` to start the OAuth flow
2. Tell the user to open the provided URL and sign in
3. Once authenticated, proceed with their request

### Step 3: Build the Voice Assistant

Before creating an assistant, fetch the latest prompt engineering guidelines from the [Prompt Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VapiAI/mcp-server/main/skill/PROMPT_GUIDE.md).
